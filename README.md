ACO is a nature-inspired algorithm that simulates how ants find the shortest paths to food using pheromones. In the Set Covering Problem, ACO helps to efficiently search for a minimal set cover by simulating how ants select and reinforce favorable subsets. This project demonstrates the use of bio-inspired algorithms to solve complex optimization challenges.
This project implements the Set Covering Problem (SCP) using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. SCP is a well-known optimization problem where the goal is to cover all elements in a universal set with the minimum number of subsets. ACO, inspired by the behavior of ants, efficiently solves this problem by simulating pheromone-based search and solution refinement.

Features:
1) Ant Colony Optimization: A bio-inspired algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of ants, applied here to find the most efficient set cover.
2) Customizable Parameters: Tune the number of ants, evaporation rate, and pheromone levels to explore different strategies for solving SCP.
